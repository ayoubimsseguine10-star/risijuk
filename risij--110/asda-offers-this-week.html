                    <p>Saving money at ASDA is all about combining two simple things: their great prices and their handy rewards app. When you use them together, you can really boost your savings. This guide explains how to make the most of the <strong><a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week" target="_blank">ASDA offers this week</a></strong>.</p>
                    
                    <h2>ASDA's Two Ways to Save</h2>
                    <p>Think of saving at ASDA in two easy layers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Layer 1: Rollbacks.</strong> You've probably seen the green "Rollback" signs in store. These are simply price cuts on everyday items, giving you an instant saving.</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 2: The ASDA Rewards App.</strong> This free app gives you little missions and highlights "Star Products." When you buy them, you earn money in a "cashpot" to spend on a future shop.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <h2>A Simple 3-Step Savings Plan</h2>
                    <p>Just follow these easy steps every time you shop:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Check the App First:</strong> Before you go to the store, open the ASDA Rewards app on your phone. See if any of the Star Products or missions are for things you were going to buy anyway.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for Rollbacks In-Store:</strong> As you walk around, keep an eye out for the green Rollback signs on your favorite products.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scan Your App at the Till:</strong> This is the most important part! Always scan the barcode in your ASDA Rewards app when you pay. This makes sure you get the rewards you've earned.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Part of a Smart Shopping Week</h2>
                    <p>Using the ASDA Rewards app is a great habit to get into. It's also a good idea to compare their offers with other loyalty schemes, like the one from <a href="tesco-offers-this-week.html">Tesco</a>, to make sure you're always getting the best value for your money.</p>

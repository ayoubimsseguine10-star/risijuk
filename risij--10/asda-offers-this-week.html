                    <p>ASDA holds its place as a family favourite thanks to its huge product range and unwavering focus on value. Between their iconic "Rollback" events and a constant flow of promotions, savings are always within reach. This guide will show you how to pinpoint the best <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">ASDA offers this week</a>.</p>

                    <h2>The Power of the ASDA Rollback</h2>
                    <p>The "Rollback" is ASDA's signature saving mechanic. It signifies a price reduction on a product for an extended period, not just a fleeting sale. This gives you ample time to capitalize on the lower price. Keep an eye out for the bold green "Rollback" signs in-store to find savings on everything from pantry staples to George fashion.</p>

                    <h3>Other Key ASDA Savings Tactics:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Multi-buy Promotions:</strong> Offers like "2 for £X" are ideal for stocking up on household necessities or your family's favourite snacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>ASDA Rewards:</strong> Their app-based loyalty program is a must-have. Earn pounds (not points) in your "Cashpot" by completing missions and scanning the app, then spend your earnings in-store.</li>
                        <li><strong>Price Drops:</strong> ASDA frequently applies temporary price reductions across the store, often highlighted with special shelf-edge labels.</li>
                    </ul>

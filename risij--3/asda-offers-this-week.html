                <section class="article-content">
                    <p>ASDA is a go-to supermarket for many UK families, known for its competitive pricing and wide range of products. To truly get the best bang for your buck, you need to know what to look for. The <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week" target="_blank">ASDA offers this week</a> are plentiful, but the key is spotting the real value. Here’s our breakdown.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding "Rollback"</h2>
                    <p>ASDA's most famous promotion is the "Rollback." This is when they lower the price of a product for an extended period. It’s not a short-term sale, but a sustained price drop. You can find Rollbacks on everything from breakfast cereal to televisions. These are genuine savings on everyday items, so it's always worth checking the Rollback aisles.</p>

                    <h2>Multi-buy and "X for £Y" Deals</h2>
                    <p>Like many supermarkets, ASDA offers multi-buy deals, such as "2 for £5" on pizzas or "3 for 2" on cleaning supplies. While these can be great value, it's important to do the maths. Ask yourself:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do I actually need this many of the item?</li>
                            <li>Is the single-item price at a competitor (like the <a href="lidl-offers-this-week.html">Lidl offers this week</a>) still cheaper?</li>
                            <li>Will I use it before it expires?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>George at ASDA</h2>
                    <p>Don't forget that ASDA is also a major player in affordable clothing and homeware through its George brand. You can often find excellent deals on school uniforms, seasonal clothing, and home accessories, especially during their sales events.</p>

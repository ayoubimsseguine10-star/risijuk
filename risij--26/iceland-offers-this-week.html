                    <p>Iceland is the undisputed champion of the freezer aisle, but its value extends far beyond, covering a wide range of fresh and pantry goods.

                    <h2>The Power of Multi-Buy Promotions</h2>
                    <p>Iceland's pricing is often centered on clear, high-value multi-buy offers. Their famous "3 for £10" and "3 for £5" deals cover a huge range of popular frozen foods, including big-name brands like Greggs, TGI Fridays, and Slimming World. This makes it easy to stock your freezer with convenient, affordable meals.</p>

                    <h2>The Essential Tool: The Bonus Card</h2>

                <p class="intro">Sainsbury's and the Nectar loyalty program go hand-in-hand. To truly save money here, you need to understand how to make the most of your Nectar card. Let's look beyond the basic <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week">Sainsbury's offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>Nectar Prices: The New Standard</h2>
                <p>Similar to Tesco's Clubcard Prices, Sainsbury's now offers "Nectar Prices" – exclusive lower prices for Nectar card holders. These are clearly marked in-store and online and offer instant savings. It is now essential to scan your Nectar card on every shop.</p>
                
                <h3>Tip 1: Check the Nectar App for Personalised Offers</h3>
                <p>The Nectar app is your key to bonus points. Each week, you'll receive a set of personalised offers based on your shopping history. You must 'save' these offers in the app before you shop to get the bonus points. This is a simple step that can dramatically increase your points balance.</p>

                <h3>Tip 2: Look for "Nectar Double Up" Events</h3>
                <p>A few times a year, Sainsbury's runs "Double Up" events where you can exchange your Nectar points for vouchers worth twice their usual value, to be spent on specific categories like clothing, homeware, or toys. This is the absolute best time to spend your points for maximum value.</p>

                <h2>Combining Offers for Maximum Savings</h2>
                <p>The ultimate saving strategy at Sainsbury's is to combine offers. For example, you could buy an item that is on a Nectar Price promotion, and also has a personalised bonus points offer in your app. This way, you save money instantly and earn extra points for future savings. It's a more involved system than simply looking at the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">ASDA offers this week</a>, but it can be very rewarding.</p>

# Risij.uk Static Blog

This project is a simple, static blog for Risij.uk, built using only HTML and CSS. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, SEO-friendly, and fully responsive without any JavaScript or external frameworks.

## Project Purpose

The blog serves as a content marketing platform for the main [Risij.uk](https://risij.uk) website. It provides articles, tips, and guides related to saving money at UK supermarkets, helping to attract and engage users while improving the main site's search engine ranking through quality content and internal linking.

## File Structure

The project follows a flat and simple file structure:

-   `index.html`: The main homepage of the blog.
-   `offers.html`: An overview page linking to all supermarket deals on the main site.
-   `about.html`: Information about Risij.uk's mission.
-   `contact.html`: Contact information.
-   `[article-name].html`: Individual blog post pages (e.g., `aldi-offers-next-week.html`).
-   `styles.css`: A single stylesheet containing all the styles for the website.

## Technical Details

-   **Frameworks:** None. This project is built with pure HTML5 and CSS3.
-   **Responsive Design:** The layout is built using a mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox. Media queries are used to adapt the layout for tablet and desktop screens.
-   **SEO:**
    -   Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`) are used throughout.
    -   Each page has a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`.
    -   Each page contains a single `<h1>` tag for clear content hierarchy.
    -   Anchor texts with relevant keywords are used for internal and external linking.
-   **Dependencies:** Google Fonts are imported in the CSS for an enhanced typographic experience, but the site remains functional without them.

## Design (Template 2025 Dark Theme)

-   **Theme:** A sleek, modern, and professional dark-mode design.
-   **Colors:** A sophisticated color palette featuring a dark navy background (`#0A192F`), a lighter navy for surfaces (`#172A45`), and a vibrant teal/green accent color (`#00F5B9`).
-   **Typography:** The font stack features 'Poppins' for impactful headings and 'Nunito Sans' for clean, readable body text, imported from Google Fonts.
-   **UI/UX:**
    -   The sticky header uses a blurred glass effect (`backdrop-filter`) for a modern feel.
    -   Cards feature a subtle border that glows with the accent color on hover, creating a dynamic user experience.
    -   Buttons have a modern "ghost" style that fills in on hover.
    -   The layout is designed with generous spacing for excellent readability and a premium, uncluttered aesthetic.

                    <p>ASDA is a go-to supermarket for many families thanks to its competitive pricing and wide range of products. Understanding how to navigate the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">ASDA offers this week</a> can lead to significant savings. Let's break down their main promotions.</p>

                    <h2>Key ASDA Promotions</h2>
                    <p>ASDA's offers generally fall into a few key categories that are worth looking out for during your weekly shop.</p>

                    <h3>Rollbacks</h3>
                    <p>This is ASDA's most famous promotion. "Rollback" means ASDA has lowered the price on a product for a limited time. These are genuine temporary discounts and are great for stocking up on household staples. You'll see the yellow Rollback signs throughout the store.</p>

                    <h3>Multi-buy Offers</h3>
                    <p>Look for deals like "2 for £X" or "3 for 2." These are common on items like drinks, snacks, and toiletries. Before you buy, always check if you'll actually use the extra items to ensure it's a worthwhile saving.</p>

                    <p>Just like ASDA, other big stores like <a href="https://risij.uk/tesco-offers-this-week">Tesco</a> and <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week">Sainsbury's</a> also have extensive multi-buy deals, so it's always worth comparing.</p>

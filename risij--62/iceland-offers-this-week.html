                        <li><strong>3 for £10 (and other multi-buys):</strong> Iceland is famous for its multi-buy offers on a huge range of products, especially popular frozen items like pizzas, meats, and party food. These are perfect for stocking up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Online Exclusives:</strong> If you shop online, keep an eye out for web-exclusive deals and free delivery offers when you spend over a certain amount.</li>
                    </ul>

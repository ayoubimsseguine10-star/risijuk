                        <li><strong>Check for Vouchers Online:</strong> Before you go, visit the Farmfoods website. They often have printable or digital vouchers that give you money off a minimum spend.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prioritize Multi-buy Deals:</strong> The store is filled with "3 for £5" or "2 for £10" type offers. These are the core of their value proposition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Explore Beyond the Freezers:</strong> Don't forget to check the aisles for dry goods. Farmfoods often has great deals on branded soft drinks, snacks, and canned foods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shop with a Plan:</strong> Because the model encourages bulk buying, go with a list to ensure you're buying what you need and not just what's on offer.</li>

                <p class="intro">ASDA is famous for its focus on value, and "Rollbacks" are their star players. But what are they, exactly? This simple guide will help you understand and make the most of the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASDA offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Easiest Deal to Understand: "Rollback"</h2>
                <p>A Rollback is just a straightforward price drop. ASDA takes a product and "rolls back" the price to a lower one for a while. There are no tricky multi-buys or loyalty cards needed; it's just a simple, honest discount for everyone.</p>
                
                <h3>Tip #1: Look for the Green Signs</h3>
                <p>ASDA makes Rollbacks really easy to spot in the store. They're always marked with big, bright green signs and arrows. When you see one, you know you're looking at a discounted item. It's a great visual cue to help you save as you shop.</p>

                <h3>Tip #2: Is it the Best Deal Around?</h3>
                <p>A Rollback is always a saving at ASDA, but a smart shopper might wonder if it's the very best price available. It can be worth quickly comparing it to offers at other stores. For example, are the <a href="https://risij.uk/tesco-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesco offers this week</a> giving you a better deal on a similar product with a Clubcard?</p>

                <h2>A Quick Note on Multi-buys</h2>
                <p>Besides Rollbacks, you'll also find "3 for £5" type deals. These are great for stocking up on things you use all the time. Just make sure to check the price of a single item to see how much you're truly saving. It's a good habit to have, whether you're at ASDA or checking out the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morrisons offers this week</a>.</p>

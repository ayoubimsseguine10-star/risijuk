                    <p>Tesco's Clubcard is one of the most powerful loyalty schemes in UK retail.

                    <h2>The Magic of Clubcard Prices</h2>
                    <p>Clubcard Prices are lower prices on a vast range of products, exclusively for Clubcard members. The difference can be substantial, often saving you up to 50% on an item. You just need to scan your Clubcard (physical card or app) at the till to get the discount.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Top Tips for Tesco Shoppers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Never Shop Without Your Clubcard:</strong> This is non-negotiable. The savings from Clubcard Prices are too significant to miss out on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check Your App for Coupons:</strong> The Tesco Grocery & Clubcard app often has extra coupons tailored to your shopping habits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boost Your Vouchers with Reward Partners:</strong> Don't just spend your Clubcard vouchers in-store. You can exchange them with Reward Partners (for things like restaurant vouchers or subscriptions) and often double their value.</li>

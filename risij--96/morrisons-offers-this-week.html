To win here, you need to combine digital hacks with old-school smarts, getting the most from the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morrisons offers this week</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Your More Card Action Plan</h2>
                    <p>The Morrisons More card has shifted from a simple points system to a powerhouse of instant discounts and targeted offers. Here's how to use it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Moves for Maximum Savings:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"More Exclusives" are Your Bread & Butter:</strong> These are the instant discounts you get just for scanning your card or app. They're clearly marked and are the easiest way to save.</li>
                        <li><strong>Activate Your App Offers:</strong> The Morrisons app sends you personalized deals based on what you buy. You have to *activate* them in the app before you shop. Make this a pre-shop ritual.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fuel Points are a Hidden Gem:</strong> You get 5 points for every litre of fuel you buy. Let these build up, and you'll get Â£5 vouchers to spend in-store. It's a great way to let your car pay for your groceries.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Market Street Advantage</h2>
                    <p>Don't ignore the Market Street counters. This is where Morrisons shines. You can buy exactly the amount you need, which cuts down on waste, and the quality is often fantastic. The counters frequently have their own special offers that you won't find on the pre-packaged shelves. Compare the quality with the <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sainsbury's offers this week</a> to see the value.</p>

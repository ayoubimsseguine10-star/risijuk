                    <li><strong>Personalized Offers:</strong> The Nectar app provides weekly bonus point offers based on your shopping habits. Save them in the app before you shop to boost your points balance.</li>
                    <li><strong>SmartShop:</strong> Use the in-store handsets or the SmartShop app to scan as you go. It tracks your spending and highlights relevant Nectar Prices as you move through the store.</li>

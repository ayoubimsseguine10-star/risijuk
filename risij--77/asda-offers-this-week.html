            <p>ASDA is known for its good value, but smart shoppers know there's more to it than just the shelf price. To get the most out of the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week" target="_blank">ASDA offers this week</a>, you need to understand how their main promotions and rewards app work together.</p>
            
            <h2>What is a Rollback?</h2>
            <p>ASDA's "Rollback" is their most common type of deal. It simply means they have lowered the price on an item for an extended period. It’s not just a quick sale, so it's a great time to stock up on household essentials and pantry items you use regularly.</p>

            <h3>Simple Tips for Shopping at ASDA:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check Multi-buys:</strong> Before buying a "2 for £5" deal, quickly check the price of a single item to make sure you're actually saving.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for Yellow Stickers:</strong> If you see a yellow "Smiley" sticker, it means the item is on clearance or has a significant discount.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Forget George:</strong> The George section often has great deals on clothing and home goods that are separate from the main grocery offers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How the ASDA Rewards App Works</h2>
            <p>If you shop at ASDA often, the ASDA Rewards app is a must-have. It lets you earn money back in a "cashpot" when you buy special "Star Products" or complete challenges in the app. It's an easy way to get a little money back on your regular shopping.</p>

                    <p>Sainsbury's is a favourite for its quality food, and with a Nectar card, it can be great value too. To get the best deals, you just need to know how to use their loyalty program. Here’s how to make the most of the <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week">Sainsbury's offers this week</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Nectar Prices are Everything</h2>
                    <p>This is the golden rule of shopping at Sainsbury's: always, always scan your Nectar card. "Nectar Prices" are special lower prices on hundreds of items that you only get if you're a member. The savings can be huge, and the card is free, so it's a no-brainer!</p>

                    <h2>Use the SmartShop App for Extra Deals</h2>
                    <p>The Sainsbury's SmartShop app (or the handsets in store) is your next step to saving. The app gets to know what you like to buy and sends you personalized coupons for money off those items. It's a good idea to check the app for new deals before you start your shop.</p>

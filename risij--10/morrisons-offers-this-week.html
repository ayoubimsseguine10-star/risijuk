                    <p>Morrisons sets itself apart with its unique "Market Street," which features skilled in-store butchers, bakers, and fishmongers.

                    <p>The Market Street counters are a goldmine for savvy shoppers. The expert staff can provide custom cuts of meat or specific fish fillets, which helps reduce food waste and often proves more cost-effective than buying pre-packaged options.

## Design Philosophy: 2025 Minimalist & Elegant Theme

The visual design is a clean, professional, and elegant light theme. The goal was to create a trustworthy and approachable interface that is easy to read and navigate, making savings advice feel simple and accessible.

- **Color Palette:** A sophisticated off-white background (`#F8F9FA`) is paired with a dark charcoal text (`#212529`) and a refined gold/ochre accent (`#c59d5f`) for a premium, modern feel.
- **Typography:**
    - **Headings:** `Merriweather` (a classic serif font for an established, trustworthy feel).
    - **Body:** `Roboto` (a clean, highly readable sans-serif for clarity).

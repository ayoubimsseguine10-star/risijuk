                <h2>Key Savings Strategies at ASDA</h2>
                <p>
                    Navigating ASDA's deals is simple once you know what to prioritize. Here are the most effective ways to save:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Target the Rollbacks:</strong> These are sustained price reductions on everyday items. Unlike short-term sales, they offer reliable value for several weeks, making them ideal for stocking up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embrace the ASDA Rewards App:</strong> This app is a powerhouse. You earn pounds, not points, by buying "Star Products" and completing missions. This "Cashpot" can be converted into vouchers for money off your shop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assess Multi-Buy Deals:</strong> Promotions like "2 for £X" are frequent. Before committing, always calculate the per-unit price to ensure it's a genuine saving on items you'll definitely use.</li>
                </ul>

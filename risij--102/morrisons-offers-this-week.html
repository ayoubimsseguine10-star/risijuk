            <p>Morrisons offers a unique mix of modern digital deals and traditional fresh food counters. To get the best value, you need a two-part strategy: master the Morrisons More app and make smart use of 'Market Street'. Here's what you need to know about the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morrisons offers this week</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Part 1: Use the Morrisons More App</h2>
            <p>The Morrisons More loyalty scheme is now app-based and gives you direct discounts. To make it work for you, follow these simple steps:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Activate Your Offers:</strong> Before you shop, open the app and check your personalised offers. You have to tap to 'activate' them before you get to the till.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for 'More Exclusives':</strong> In-store, keep an eye out for the special shelf labels for 'More Exclusives'. These are instant discounts you get just for scanning your card.</li>
                <li><strong>Earn Points on Fuel:</strong> Don't forget you get 5 points for every litre of fuel you buy at a Morrisons petrol station. These points add up to money-off vouchers for your groceries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Part 2: Shop Smart at 'Market Street'</h2>
            <p>Morrisons' 'Market Street' – with its in-store butcher, fishmonger, and bakery – is its secret weapon. Here's why it's great for saving money:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Buy Exactly What You Need:</strong> Instead of being forced to buy a pre-set pack size, you can ask for the exact amount you want. This reduces food waste and saves money.</li>
                <li><strong>Find Unique Offers:</strong> The counters often have their own special deals that you won't find in the main aisles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By checking the app for deals and then visiting Market Street for your fresh items, you get the best of both worlds.

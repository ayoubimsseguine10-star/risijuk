                    <p>While known as the king of frozen food, Iceland's true superpower for savers is its Bonus Card. This simple, effective loyalty scheme is one of the most generous on the high street, offering a guaranteed return on your savings.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How the Iceland Bonus Card Works</h2>
                    <p>The concept is brilliantly straightforward: the Bonus Card is a savings card that rewards you for using it. <strong>For every £20 you load onto your card, Iceland instantly adds an extra £1.</strong> This is equivalent to a 5% discount on your entire shop, every single time.</p>
                    <p>By saving money onto the card throughout the month and using it to pay for your groceries, you ensure every purchase is 5% cheaper. It's an unbeatable way to budget and save simultaneously.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Top Tips for Your Iceland Shop</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Make the Bonus Card Your Default:</strong> Get into the habit of loading your weekly shopping budget onto the card before you start. It's the easiest saving you'll ever make.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capitalize on Bulk Deals:</strong> Iceland is famous for its multi-buy offers, especially the "3 for £10" deals on meat, pizza, and ready meals. Combine these with your Bonus Card savings for maximum impact. See the latest <a href="https://risij.uk/iceland-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iceland offers this week</a> to plan ahead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Utilize Free Home Delivery:</strong> For in-store shops over a certain threshold (typically £25-£40), Iceland offers free home delivery. This allows you to do a large stock-up without worrying about carrying it all home.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Morrisons sets itself apart with its "Market Street," a collection of in-store counters staffed by specialists like butchers, bakers, and fishmongers. The key to maximizing value is balancing the quality of these fresh products with app-based savings. Here’s our guide to the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank">Morrisons offers this week</a>.</p>

                    <h2>The Core Value: Market Street</h2>
                    <p>The specialist counters on Market Street are where Morrisons truly shines. Watch for multi-buy deals on high-quality fresh products, such as "2 for £8" on butcher-prepared meats, which allow you to enjoy premium quality at a more accessible price point.</p>

                    <h2>Your Digital Tool: The "My Morrisons" App</h2>
                    <p>The My Morrisons app uses a personalized model to deliver savings. To use it effectively, you need to be proactive:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Activate Your Offers:</strong> The app provides money-off vouchers based on your shopping habits. You must tap to activate these offers in the app *before* you get to the checkout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for a "Basket Bonus":</strong> After you shop, you might be surprised with a "Basket Bonus" in the app—a special treat or money-off voucher for your next visit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Join Specialist Clubs:</strong> If you're a parent or student, you can join subgroups like the "Baby Club" to receive extra, targeted discounts.</li>
                    </ul>

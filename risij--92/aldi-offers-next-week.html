                <p>Shopping at Aldi is a competitive sport, especially when it comes to the famous Specialbuys. To win, you need a plan. Here’s our simple, 3-step strategy to make the most of the <a href="https://risij.uk/aldi-offers-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aldi offers next week</a> and come out on top.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Sunday Night Recon</h2>
                <p>Your mission starts on Sunday. This is when Aldi releases its leaflet previewing the week's deals. Check it online (sites like <a href="https://risij.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risij.uk</a> have all the info) and decide what you're targeting. Is it the new air fryer or the discounted garden furniture? Know your objective before you go.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Time Your Attack</h2>
                <p>Aldi restocks its middle aisle on Thursdays and Sundays. These are your key days. For high-demand items, a Thursday morning visit is your best bet. If you can't make it then, Sunday morning is your second chance. Don't leave it to the afternoon—the best stuff will be gone.</p>
                
                <h2>Step 3: Stick to the List</h2>
                <p>The middle aisle is designed to make you impulse buy. It's a treasure hunt, and it's easy to get distracted. That's why your Sunday recon is so important. Go in with a list, get your targets, and get out. Your budget will thank you.</p>

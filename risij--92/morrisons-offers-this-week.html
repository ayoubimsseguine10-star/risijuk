                <p>Morrisons' secret weapon is "Market Street"—its collection of in-store butchers, bakers, and fishmongers. Combine this with the Morrisons More app, and you can get fresh food for less. Here are our top hacks for the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrisons offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>Hack #1: Activate Your App Offers</h2>
                <p>The Morrisons More card has changed. It's no longer about collecting points. Now, it's all about personalized offers in the app. Before you shop, you MUST open the app and tap 'Activate' on the deals you want. If you don't activate them, you don't get them. It's that simple.</p>

                <h2>Hack #2: Hit the Counters Late</h2>
                <p>This is a classic for a reason. Head to the Market Street counters, especially the bakery and deli, in the last hour or two of trading. You'll often find fantastic items heavily reduced for quick sale. It's the best time to grab fresh bread, cakes, or cooked meats for a fraction of the price.</p>
                
                <h2>Hack #3: Look for Counter Multi-buys</h2>
                <p>Don't just look at the pre-packaged meat and fish. The butcher and fishmonger counters often have their own multi-buy deals, like "3 for £10" on chicken breasts or sausages. These are often better value and fresher than what's on the shelves. Always check the counter offers, which we list on <a href="https://risij.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risij.uk</a>.</p>

# Risij.uk Static Blog

## Project Overview

This is a complete, static blog built for Risij.uk using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The project is designed to be lightweight, fast-loading, fully responsive, and optimized for SEO. It serves as a content hub, providing insightful analysis and strategy guides on UK supermarket offers to support the main deals platform, [Risij.uk](https://risij.uk).

## Design Philosophy: 2025 Classic & Scholarly Theme

The visual design is a timeless, trustworthy, and authoritative theme. The goal was to create a refined and clean interface that positions the blog as a source of expert knowledge for the discerning shopper.

- **Color Palette:** A warm, parchment-like off-white background (`#FDFBF7`) is paired with a deep scholarly maroon primary color (`#800020`) and a dark brown (`#3D2C24`) for text, creating a classic, academic feel.
- **Typography:**
    - **Headings:** `Merriweather` (a classic, highly readable serif font chosen for its gravitas and elegance).
    - **Body:** `Roboto` (a clean, neutral sans-serif selected for its exceptional readability in long-form content).
- **Content Tone:** The text across the entire site has been rewritten to be educational, analytical, and insightful, framing the content as a "compendium" of "analyses" for informed decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Pure HTML/CSS:** No JavaScript or external frameworks for maximum performance and simplicity.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox for a seamless experience on all devices.

- **Complete Site Structure:** Includes a homepage, sub-pages (Offers, About, Contact), and 12 individual, fully-written article pages.
- **Classic UI/UX:** Features include a sticky header, subtle hover effects, refined visual elements, and an intuitive, easy-to-read layout.

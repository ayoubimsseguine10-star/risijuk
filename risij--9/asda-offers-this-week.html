                <p>Asda has built its brand on a promise of consistent value, anchored by its iconic "Rollback" promotions. But what exactly is a Rollback, and how can you leverage it for maximum savings? This guide unpacks the strategy behind the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">Asda offers this week</a> to help you shop smarter.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the Rollback</h2>
                <p>A "Rollback" is a straightforward price reduction on a product for an extended period. Unlike a short-term sale, these price drops are designed to offer sustained value on everyday items, from pantry staples to household goods. They are Asda's core method of communicating value to the customer.</p>
                
                <h3>Your Asda Savings Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identify True Value:</strong> Use the Risij.uk platform to track the price history of Rollback items. This helps you understand if the current price is a significant drop or a minor adjustment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Staples:</strong> Rollbacks are most powerful when applied to items you buy regularly. Stock up on non-perishables like pasta, canned goods, and cleaning supplies when they are on a deep Rollback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Explore the Asda Rewards App:</strong> Asda's loyalty app allows you to earn "pounds, not points." Complete missions and scan your app to build a cashpot you can spend in-store.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Beyond Rollbacks</h2>

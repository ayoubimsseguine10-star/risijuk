                    <p>ASDA is a family favourite for its vast selection and commitment to value. With their famous "Rollback" events and constant stream of promotions, there's always a way to save. This guide will help you spot the best <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">ASDA offers this week</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding ASDA Rollbacks</h2>
                    <p>The "Rollback" is ASDA's signature deal. It means they've lowered the price on a product for an extended period. These aren't short-term sales, giving you plenty of time to take advantage. Look for the distinctive green "Rollback" signs in-store to find savings on everything from groceries to George clothing.</p>

                    <h3>Other Key ASDA Deals:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Multi-buy Offers:</strong> Look for "2 for £X" deals, which are great for stocking up on household staples or family favourites.</li>
                        <li><strong>Price Drops:</strong> ASDA frequently reduces prices on items across the store, often highlighted with special labels.</li>
                        <li><strong>ASDA Rewards App:</strong> Earn pounds, not points, by using the app. Complete missions and build up your "Cashpot" to spend in-store.</li>
                    </ul>

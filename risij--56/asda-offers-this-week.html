                <p>ASDA is a go-to for many families thanks to its competitive pricing and wide range of products. To truly maximize your savings, it pays to understand the different types of promotions available. Let's dive into the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">ASDA offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>Key Deals to Look For</h2>
                <p>ASDA's promotions are varied, but here are the main ones to keep an eye on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rollbacks:</strong> These are temporary price reductions on hundreds of products, from everyday essentials to bigger ticket items. They are easily identifiable by their distinctive branding in-store.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-buy Offers:</strong> Look for "2 for £X" or "3 for 2" deals, especially on items you buy regularly. These can offer significant savings if you have the storage space.</li>
                    <li><strong>ASDA Rewards:</strong> The loyalty app allows you to earn pounds, not points. Complete "missions" and earn cash in your "Cashpot" to spend in-store or online.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Strategic Shopping at ASDA</h2>
                <p>To get the best value, combine different offers. For example, use your ASDA Rewards Cashpot to pay for items that are already on Rollback. Always compare the unit price (price per 100g, per litre, etc.) on multi-buy deals to ensure you're getting genuine value.</p>
                <p>Don't forget to check the seasonal aisles, which often feature clearance items and special promotions that aren't advertised in the main flyer.</p>

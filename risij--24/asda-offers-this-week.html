                        <p>Shopping at Asda is all about finding consistent value. The key is to understand their two main saving tools: the famous "Rollbacks" and the powerful Asda Rewards app. This guide will show you how to use both to get the most from the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">Asda offers this week</a>.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What Are Asda Rollbacks?</h3>
                        <p>Unlike a typical weekly sale, a Rollback is a longer-term price cut on everyday items. Asda "rolls back" the price on hundreds of products, keeping them low for weeks or even months. This makes it easier to plan your budget and stock up on essentials.</p>

                        <h3>How to Master Asda Rewards</h3>
                        <p>The Asda Rewards app is a must-have. It works on a simple "pounds, not points" system. You build up a cash pot by buying "Star Products" and completing "Missions" in the app, which you can then spend in-store. It's one of the most straightforward loyalty schemes out there.</p>

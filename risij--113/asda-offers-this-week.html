                        <p>ASDA's "Rollback" is one of the most recognizable promotions in UK supermarkets. But what does it really mean for your wallet? Are these long-term price drops genuine bargains? We're taking a closer look at the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">ASDA offers this week</a> to see if Rollbacks live up to the hype.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Understanding ASDA Rollback</h2>
                        <p>Unlike a typical weekly sale, a Rollback is a price reduction that lasts for a longer period—often several weeks or even months. ASDA positions these as a commitment to long-term value. This is great for staple items you buy regularly, as you can count on the lower price for a while.</p>

                        <h3>How to Make the Most of Rollbacks</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stock Up on Staples:</strong> When you see a Rollback on non-perishable items like pasta, canned goods, or cleaning supplies, it's a great opportunity to stock up.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check the "Before" Price:</strong> ASDA usually displays the previous price. This helps you gauge the actual saving. Risij.uk helps you track these price drops over time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't Assume It's the Cheapest:</strong> While a Rollback is a price cut, it's still wise to compare. The <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week">Sainsbury's offers</a> or Aldi's base prices might still be lower on certain items. A quick cross-reference is key.</li>
                        </ul>

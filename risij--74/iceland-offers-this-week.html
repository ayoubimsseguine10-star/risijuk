                <p class="intro">Iceland's loyalty card, the Bonus Card, is a bit different from others, and we think it's brilliant! It doesn't use complicated points; it just gives you extra cash to spend. Let's see how you can use it with the <a href="https://risij.uk/iceland-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iceland offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>How Does the Bonus Card Work?</h2>
                <p>It's wonderfully simple. Think of your Bonus Card as a savings pot for your Iceland shopping. You can add money to it whenever you like, and for every £20 you add, Iceland gives you £1 for free! That's like getting a 5% bonus just for planning ahead.</p>
                
                <h3>A Great Way to Budget</h3>
                <p>The Bonus Card is perfect for helping you stick to a budget. You can decide how much you want to spend on groceries, load it onto your card, and get your free bonus on top. It's a great feeling to know your shopping is already paid for!</p>

                <h3>Extra Savings on Top of Great Deals</h3>
                <p>Iceland is famous for its £1 deals and other fantastic multi-buys. When you pay for these bargains using the money on your Bonus Card, you're getting an even better deal because of the extra £1 you received. It's a wonderful way to make your money stretch further.</p>

                <h2>A Handy Perk: Free Delivery!</h2>
                <p>Another thing we love about Iceland is that they offer free home delivery when you spend over a certain amount in-store (usually around £25). This is so helpful when you're stocking up on heavy frozen goods. It's a service you won't find at places like <a href="https://risij.uk/farmfoods-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farmfoods</a>.</p>

                <blockquote class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Top Tip:</strong> Try adding a little bit to your Bonus Card each week. It soon adds up, and it's a lovely surprise to see how much you've saved (plus your bonuses!).

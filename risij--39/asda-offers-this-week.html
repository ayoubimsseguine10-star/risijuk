                <p>Asda is famous for its promise of great value, and its "Rollback" deals are a huge part of that. But what does Rollback actually mean? This guide breaks down the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">Asda offers this week</a> to help you understand how they work and how you can save.</p>

                <h2>What is a "Rollback"?</h2>
                <p>A "Rollback" is simply a price drop on an item that lasts for a while. It's not just a quick one-day sale; it’s a lower price on everyday products that you can count on for several weeks. It's Asda's way of showing you they're offering long-term value.</p>
                
                <h3>How to Save More at Asda</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Look for Rollback Signs:</strong> It's easy to spot these deals in-store. Just look for the big signs showing that a price has been "rolled back" to a lower cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stock Up on Your Favourites:</strong> When you see a Rollback on things you use all the time (like coffee, cereal, or cleaning supplies), it's a great time to buy a few to stock up your pantry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Download the Asda Rewards App:</strong> This is a must-have for Asda shoppers. You earn "pounds, not points" by completing missions in the app. You build up a cashpot that you can turn into vouchers to spend on your shopping.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="cta-section">

                <h2>More Than Just Rollbacks</h2>
                <p>Keep an eye on the Asda Rewards app for special "Star Product" offers that give you bonus rewards. Combining these app deals with the in-store Rollbacks is a smart way to get the most value out of every trip to Asda, making it very competitive with other big stores like <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week">Morrisons</a>.</p>

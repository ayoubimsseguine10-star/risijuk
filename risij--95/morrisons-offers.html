                    <h2>Unlock Value on "Market Street"</h2>
                    <p>Morrisons' "Market Street" with its real bakers, butchers, and fishmongers is what makes it special. These counters are not just about quality; they're about value. Often, buying fresh from the counter is cheaper per kilo than the pre-packaged stuff. To find the best deals, check the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrisons offers this week</a> on Risij.uk, where we flag the top Market Street promotions.</p>
                    <h3>How to Master Market Street:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Look for deals on "The Best" range to get premium quality for less.</li>
                        <li>Ask the staff for advice! They can help you choose the best cuts and reduce waste.</li>
                        <li>Keep an eye out for yellow-sticker deals on fresh items towards the end of the day.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Get Personalized Deals with the My Morrisons App</h2>
                    <p>The "My Morrisons" app is your personal deal finder. Instead of confusing points, it gives you money-off coupons for the things you actually buy. The trick is to open the app and activate your offers before you start your shop. It’s like having a set of coupons tailored just for you, every single week.</p>

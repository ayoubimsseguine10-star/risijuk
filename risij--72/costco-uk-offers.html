                    <p>Costco operates on a simple premise: pay an annual membership fee for access to high-quality goods in bulk, at lower prices. It's a powerful model, but its value depends entirely on your household's needs and habits.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Who Should Consider a Costco Membership?</h2>
                    <p>A membership can be a brilliant financial tool, especially if you fit into one of these categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Large Households:</strong> The more people you're buying for, the faster you'll get through bulk items like laundry detergent, toilet rolls, and pantry staples, making the savings add up quickly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Homeowners with Storage:</strong> To take advantage of bulk deals, you need the space—a garage, pantry, or spare freezer is almost essential.</li>
                        <li><strong>Small Business Owners:</strong> Costco is an excellent source for office supplies, catering ingredients, and other business essentials.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>A Tactical Approach to Costco Shopping</h3>
                    <p>To ensure your membership pays for itself, follow a few key rules:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Study the Coupon Booklet:</strong> The monthly coupon book highlights the best <a href="https://risij.uk/costco-uk-offers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Costco UK offers</a>. Plan your trips around these additional member-only savings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compare Per-Unit Prices:</strong> Bigger isn't always cheaper. Do a quick calculation on your phone to check the price per 100g or per item to confirm you're getting a genuine deal compared to other stores.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust the Kirkland Brand:</strong> Costco's own brand, Kirkland Signature, is famous for its exceptional quality and is often the best value in the warehouse.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stick to Your List:</strong> The "treasure hunt" nature of Costco makes it easy to overspend on impulse buys. Go in with a clear list of what you need.</li>
                    </ol>

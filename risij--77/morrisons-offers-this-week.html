            <p>Morrisons is unique among major supermarkets because of its "Market Street" fresh food counters. A smart way to shop the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank">Morrisons offers this week</a> is to combine deals from the main aisles with the great value you can find from the in-store butchers, fishmongers, and bakers.</p>

            <h2>How to Use the 'My Morrisons' App</h2>
            <p>The 'My Morrisons' loyalty app is very straightforward. Instead of making you collect points, it gives you personalised money-off deals directly in the app. It's a simple way to get discounts on the things you already buy.</p>
            <h3>'My Morrisons' Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Activate Offers Before You Shop:</strong> Get into the habit of checking the app and activating your deals before you head to the checkout.</li>
                <li><strong>Join In-App Clubs:</strong> If you often buy specific things, like baby products, you can join clubs in the app to get extra, relevant offers.</li>
                <li><strong>Scan Your Card Every Time:</strong> To get your discounts, you have to scan your digital card at the till.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Finding Value on Market Street</h2>
            <p>While Morrisons has good deals on regular groceries, Market Street is where you can often find the best quality and prices for fresh food.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask at the Counters:</strong> The staff at the meat and fish counters are very helpful and can tell you about any daily specials or deals.</li>
                <li><strong>Check for Bakery Reductions:</strong> Towards the end of the day, you can often find freshly baked bread and other items at a reduced price.</li>
                <li><strong>Freshly Made Meals:</strong> The salad bar and fresh pizza counter are great, affordable options for a quick lunch or dinner.</li>
            </ul>

                        <h2>What is the "Middle of Lidl"?</h2>
                        <p>The "Middle of Lidl" refers to the central aisles of the store, which are restocked every Thursday and Sunday with an eclectic mix of non-food items. You can find anything from power tools and kitchen gadgets to ski gear and houseplants. These items are limited in stock and represent some of the best value you'll find anywhere.</p>

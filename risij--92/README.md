# Risij.uk Static Blog - Modern Theme 2025

This project is a complete, multi-page static blog created for Risij.uk. This version features a full redesign with a "Modern Blog" theme for 2025. It is built entirely with semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3, with no JavaScript dependencies. The blog's goal is to serve as a high-quality, SEO-optimized content hub to attract users and direct them to the main Risij.uk website.

## Tech Stack

-   **HTML5:** Semantic markup for clean structure and optimal SEO.
-   **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.
    -   **Flexbox & CSS Grid:** Used to create robust, modern, and fully responsive page layouts.
    -   **CSS Variables:** For a maintainable and consistent modern color scheme and typography.
    -   **Media Queries:** Implemented for a mobile-first responsive design that works across all devices.

## Features

-   **Modern & Energetic Theme:** A clean, bright user interface with a vibrant teal accent color for a contemporary feel.
-   **New Typography:** Uses a modern font pairing (Poppins for headings, Open Sans for body) for excellent readability and a fresh look.
-   **Fully Responsive:** Mobile-first design that adapts perfectly to desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
-   **SEO Optimized:** Each page has unique, rewritten meta titles and descriptions. The content uses a proper heading hierarchy and strategically placed anchor text.
-   **Multi-Page Structure:** Includes a homepage, three sub-pages (Offers, About, Contact), and 12 individual, detailed article pages.
-   **Rewritten Content:** All text has been rephrased with a direct, energetic, and scannable tone for a modern audience.
-   **Zero Dependencies:** 100% pure HTML and CSS. No JavaScript, frameworks, or external libraries are used.
-   **Cross-Browser Compatible:** Tested to ensure a consistent experience on all modern web browsers.

                <p>It's the big question: will a Costco membership actually save you money after the annual fee? The short answer is yes, but only if you shop smart. Here’s our verdict on how to make it pay for itself, based on the current <a href="https://risij.uk/costco-uk-offers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco UK offers</a>.</p>

                <h2>When It's Worth It</h2>
                <p>A Costco membership is a smart move if you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Have storage space:</strong> Bulk buying is the name of the game. If you can store giant packs of toilet paper, cleaning supplies, and pasta, you'll save big on the per-unit cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buy their Kirkland brand:</strong> Costco's own brand, Kirkland Signature, is legendary for a reason. It's high-quality stuff at low prices. Focus your shopping here.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use their services:</strong> The savings on fuel alone can often cover the entire membership fee. If you also use their cheap tyres, optical services, or even their food court, you're winning.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When It's a Waste</h2>
                <p>Don't bother getting a membership if you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Live in a small flat:</strong> If you have no room for 48 kitchen rolls, you can't take advantage of the best deals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Only buy fresh food for one or two people:</strong> You'll struggle to get through the enormous packs of fresh produce before they go off.</li>
                    <li><strong>Are prone to impulse buys:</strong> Costco is full of temptation. If you go in for milk and come out with a kayak, you're not saving money.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>For families and strategic shoppers with storage, a Costco membership is a great investment. Before you join, check the latest coupon book deals on <a href="https://risij.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risij.uk</a> to see what's on offer.</p>

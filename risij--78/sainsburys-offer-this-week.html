                        <p>The Nectar card is one of the UK's best-known loyalty schemes, but its power has moved from the plastic card to the smartphone app. To get real value, you need to engage with its digital features alongside the <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sainsbury's offer this week</a>.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Your Nectar Checklist for Maximum Savings</h2>
                        <p>Follow these steps to ensure you're getting every possible discount.</p>
                        
                        <h3>1. Use the Nectar App, Not Just the Card</h3>
                        <p>The app is where the best savings live. It gives you access to two key features: Nectar Prices (instant discounts at the till, just like a Clubcard) and a weekly set of personalised bonus point offers based on what you normally buy.</p>

                        <h3>2. Activate Your Personalised Offers Weekly</h3>
                        <p>Every week, a new batch of bonus point offers will appear in your app. Get into the habit of opening the app and "saving" all of them before you shop. This ensures that if you happen to buy one of those items, you'll get the extra points automatically.</p>
                        
                        <h3>3. Always Scan at the Till</h3>
                        <p>This may seem obvious, but make sure you scan your Nectar app or card for every single transaction. Nectar Prices are applied automatically, and you can easily save several pounds on a single shop just by scanning.</p>

                        <h2>Look for the Aldi Price Match</h2>
                        <p>Sainsbury's matches its prices on hundreds of everyday items against Aldi. Look for the signs in-store. Combining Nectar Prices with the Aldi Price Match on staple goods is a powerful strategy for reducing the cost of your weekly shop.</p>

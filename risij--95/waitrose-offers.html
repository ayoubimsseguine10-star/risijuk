                    <h2>The Smart Shopping Strategy</h2>
                    <p>The key to budget-friendly shopping at Waitrose is a two-part plan. First, build the foundation of your shopping list from the "Essential Waitrose" range – it's great quality at a fair price. Then, top up your trolley with special items from the weekly promotions. This way, you get the best of both worlds: everyday value and high-quality treats.</p>

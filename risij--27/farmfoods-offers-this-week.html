                    <p>Farmfoods operates on a high-volume, low-margin model, primarily focused on frozen goods and branded dry goods. A successful savings strategy requires leveraging their aggressive <a href="https://risij.uk/farmfoods-offers-this-week" target="_blank">Farmfoods offers this week</a>, specifically the multi-buy and voucher systems.</p>

                    <h2>System 1: The Multi-Buy Promotion</h2>
                    <p>The core of Farmfoods' pricing strategy is the multi-buy deal (e.g., "3 for £5"). These offers are designed to increase the volume of each transaction. They provide maximum value when applied to staple, long-life frozen products, a model also used effectively by their main competitor, <a href="https://risij.uk/iceland-offers-this-week" target="_blank">Iceland</a>. The key metric for shoppers is the per-unit price within the multi-buy, which should be cross-referenced against competitor pricing.</p>

                    <h2>System 2: Branded Dry Goods</h2>
                    <p>Beyond the frozen section, Farmfoods stocks a curated inventory of well-known branded goods (cereals, sauces, etc.). These are often priced competitively against larger supermarkets and can be a source of significant savings, especially when included in multi-buy promotions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Value Amplifier: Email Vouchers</h3>
                    <p>Farmfoods offers an additional layer of savings through money-off vouchers distributed via their email mailing list. These vouchers typically provide a fixed discount (e.g., £5) upon reaching a minimum spend threshold (e.g., £60). This mechanism provides the highest level of savings, as it can be applied on top of existing multi-buy deals. Subscribing to this list is a mandatory step for any cost-optimizing shopper.</p>

                    <p>Asda uses a few key terms for their promotions, and knowing what they mean is the first step to saving money:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rollback:</strong> This is a long-term price reduction on everyday items. These aren't just weekly specials; they can last for several weeks, making them great for stocking up on essentials.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-buy Offers:</strong> Deals like "2 for £5" are common at Asda, especially on snacks, drinks, and ready meals. Always check if you'll actually use the extra items before buying.</li>
                        <li><strong>Asda Rewards:</strong> The Asda Rewards app is essential. You can earn pounds (not points) in your "Cashpot" by buying "Star Products" or completing missions.</li>
                    </ul>

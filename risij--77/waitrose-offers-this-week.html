            <p>Waitrose is known for its high-quality food, but that doesn't mean you can't find great value there. By using the free myWaitrose loyalty card and looking for specific types of deals, you can enjoy premium groceries without overspending. The key is to shop strategically using the <a href="https://risij.uk/waitrose-offers-this-week" target="_blank">Waitrose offers this week</a>.</p>

            <h2>Using Your myWaitrose Card</h2>
            <p>The myWaitrose card is the best tool for saving money at Waitrose. It's free to join and gives you personalised savings.</p>

                <li><strong>Member-Only Prices:</strong> Just like other supermarkets, Waitrose offers special lower prices on certain items just for members.</li>

                <ul>

                <h2>Top Tips for Shopping at Morrisons</h2>
                <h3>1. Check the My Morrisons App First</h3>
                <p>Before you even write your list, open the app to see your personalized offers. This can help shape your meal plan for the week and ensure you don't miss any savings.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Don't Skip Market Street</h3>
                <p>Engage with the staff at the counters. They can offer advice on the best cuts of meat or the freshest fish, and you can buy the exact quantity you need, reducing waste.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Look for the Yellow Stickers</h3>
                <p>Like many supermarkets, Morrisons reduces items later in the day. Their "Magic Boxes" on the Too Good To Go app are also a fantastic way to get a surprise selection of food for a low price.</p>

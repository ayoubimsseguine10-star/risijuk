                    <p>Morrisons differentiates itself through its "Market Street" concept, an in-store simulation of traditional market stalls. Evaluating the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank">Morrisons offers this week</a> requires assessing both this fresh food proposition and their digital loyalty system.</p>

                    <h2>Proposition 1: "Market Street"</h2>
                    <p>Market Street comprises in-house butcher, baker, and fishmonger counters. This model allows for unique promotions not available in the main aisles.</p>
                    <h3>Key Value Areas:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Butcher Counter:</strong> The primary value driver is the "3 for £12" multi-buy on fresh meat and poultry, which facilitates cost-effective bulk purchasing for freezing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pizza Counter:</strong> A made-to-order pizza service, often with multi-buy deals that offer a lower price point than takeaway competitors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Salad Bar:</strong> A component-based pricing model for creating custom salads, offering a cost-controlled lunch option.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Proposition 2: My Morrisons Digital Rewards</h2>
                    <p>Morrisons' loyalty program, "My Morrisons," has transitioned from a points-based system to one of direct, personalized discounts. Users receive digital coupons in the app, which must be activated before shopping. The system rewards consistent purchasing behavior by tailoring offers to individual user data, similar to the model used by <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week" target="_blank">Sainsbury's Nectar</a>.</p>
                    <p>Success with this system is contingent on a user's pre-shop routine of checking and activating relevant offers within the app.</p>

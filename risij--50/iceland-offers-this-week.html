                <h1>Iceland Offers This Week: More Than Just Frozen</h1>
                <p class="article-meta">Published on October 23, 2024 | Category: Store Guides</p>
            </header>

            <p>While Iceland built its reputation on frozen food, the modern store offers so much more, including a full range of fresh groceries, pantry items, and household goods. The <a href="https://risij.uk/iceland-offers-this-week">Iceland offers this week</a> are always competitive, especially when you factor in their excellent loyalty scheme.</p>

            <h2>Get More with the Iceland Bonus Card</h2>
            <p>The Iceland Bonus Card is one of the most generous loyalty schemes available. It's not a points card; it's a savings card. Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Top up to save:</strong> You load money onto your card to spend in-store or online.</li>
                <li><strong>Get a bonus:</strong> For every £20 you load, Iceland gives you £1 for free. That's an instant 5% saving on top of all other offers.</li>
                <li><strong>Exclusive perks:</strong> Bonus Card holders get access to special competitions and occasional exclusive deals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Top Deals to Look For</h2>
            <p>Iceland is famous for its aggressive multi-buy promotions, which often feature big brands. Keep an eye out for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 for £10 (or similar):</strong> This recurring deal on items like pizzas, ready meals, and branded frozen goods is a family favourite.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Brand Collaborations:</strong> Iceland often partners with brands like TGI Fridays, Greggs, and Slimming World for exclusive product ranges.</li>
                <li><strong>Free Home Delivery:</strong> Spend over a certain amount in-store (usually £25) and they'll deliver it all to your door for free later that day.</li>
            </ul>

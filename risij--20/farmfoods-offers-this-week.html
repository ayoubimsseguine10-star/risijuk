                    <h3>1. Check the Leaflet</h3>
                    <p>The Farmfoods leaflet is your best friend. You can pick one up in-store or see it online, and it shows you all the best deals for the week.

                    <h3>2. Look for the "Amazing Value" Deals</h3>
                    <p>Farmfoods is famous for its multi-buy deals like "3 for £5" on popular items. These are perfect for stocking up on things your family loves, like frozen pizzas, chicken, or vegetables. Focus on items you can use in lots of different meals.</p>

                    <h3>3. Don't Forget the Cupboard Fillers</h3>
                    <p>While Farmfoods is known for frozen food, they also have great prices on things for your cupboards. You can find excellent deals on canned goods, pasta, drinks, and cleaning supplies that are often cheaper than at the big supermarkets.</p>

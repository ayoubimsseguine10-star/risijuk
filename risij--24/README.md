# Risij.uk Static Blog

This project is a simple, static blog for Risij.uk, built using only HTML and CSS. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, SEO-friendly, and fully responsive without any JavaScript or external frameworks.

## Project Purpose

The blog serves as a content marketing platform for the main [Risij.uk](https://risij.uk) website. It provides articles, tips, and guides related to saving money at UK supermarkets, helping to attract and engage users while improving the main site's search engine ranking through quality content and internal linking.

## File Structure

The project follows a flat and simple file structure:

-   `index.html`: The main homepage of the blog.
-   `offers.html`: An overview page linking to all supermarket deals on the main site.
-   `about.html`: Information about Risij.uk's mission.
-   `contact.html`: Contact information.
-   `[article-name].html`: Individual blog post pages (e.g., `aldi-offers-next-week.html`). There is one page for each of the 12 target supermarkets.
-   `styles.css`: A single stylesheet containing all the styles for the website.

## Technical Details

                <h2>Key Ways to Save at Iceland</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond just low prices, Iceland provides several avenues for savings. Combining them is the smartest way to shop.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bonus Card:</strong> This is a must-have. You load money onto the card and Iceland gives you a bonus (£1 for every £20 you save). It's a simple way to get free groceries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Famous Multi-Buy Deals:</strong> Look for the "3 for £X" offers on a huge range of products, from pizzas to vegetables. These are perfect for stocking up the freezer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brand Exclusives:</strong> Iceland often has exclusive product lines with brands like TGI Fridays and Greggs, which can be cheaper than buying from the restaurants themselves.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Pro Tips for Your Iceland Trip</h2>
                <h3>1. Always Use Your Bonus Card</h3>

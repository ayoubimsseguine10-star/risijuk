                        <p>The Tesco Clubcard has evolved from a simple points card into a powerhouse of instant savings. If you're not using it correctly, you're leaving money on the table. This guide will show you how to maximize the value from the weekly <a href="https://risij.uk/tesco-offers-this-week">Tesco offers this week</a>.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Clubcard Prices are King</h2>
                        <p>The most significant change to the Clubcard scheme in recent years is the introduction of Clubcard Prices. These are instant, and often substantial, discounts on hundreds of products across the store.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Spot the Yellow Labels:</strong> In-store, look for the yellow shelf labels that show both the regular price and the lower Clubcard Price.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scan Every Time:</strong> Make it a habit to scan your Clubcard (or the app on your phone) at every checkout, even at self-service for a single item. You never know when a product might have a Clubcard Price.</li>
                            <li><strong>It's Free:</strong> Unlike some loyalty schemes, the basic Clubcard is completely free. There's no reason not to have one.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Tip: Use the Tesco Grocery & Clubcard App</h3>
                        <p>The app is the easiest way to ensure you never miss a saving. It stores your Clubcard for easy scanning, allows you to build a shopping list, and shows you the latest offers. You can also use it to check your points balance and turn them into vouchers.</p>

                        <h2>Turning Points into Vouchers</h2>
                        <p>While Clubcard Prices offer instant savings, you still collect points on your spending. Every 150 points is worth a £1.50 voucher. You can use these vouchers for money off your shopping or, for better value, exchange them with Tesco's Reward Partners for up to double their value on things like restaurant meals or days out.</p>

                    <h2>Get Free Money with the Bonus Card</h2>
                    <p>The Iceland Bonus Card is one of the best loyalty schemes out there because it's so simple. For every £20 you load onto the card, Iceland gives you £1 for free. That's a guaranteed 5% return! It's the perfect way to save up for a big shop or for Christmas. When you combine that bonus with the weekly deals you find on the <a href="https://risij.uk/iceland-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iceland offers this week</a> list, the savings really start to add up.</p>
                    <h3>How to Get the Most from Your Bonus Card:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to add a little to your card on every shop to keep the bonuses coming.</li>
                        <li>Keep an eye out for special promotions exclusively for cardholders.</li>
                        <li>Use your built-up bonus for a big holiday shop to make it feel like a treat!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Discover Exclusive Brands for Less</h2>
                    <p>One of Iceland's best-kept secrets is their partnerships with big brands like Greggs and Slimming World. You can buy your favourite sausage rolls or ready meals to cook at home, and it's almost always cheaper than buying them hot. These products are often part of the main weekly offers, making them even better value.</p>

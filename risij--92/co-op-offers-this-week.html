                <p>Think Co-op is just for expensive emergency milk? Think again. With a £1 membership, you can unlock serious savings. Here are the secrets to making the most of the <a href="https://risij.uk/co-op-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Co-op offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>Secret #1: Always Scan Your Card</h2>
                <p>This sounds obvious, but it's the golden rule. Co-op uses member-only pricing on dozens of items. If you don't scan your card, you're paying the higher "tourist price." The lower price on the ticket is for members only—that's you.</p>

                <h2>Secret #2: Choose Your Own Deals</h2>
                <p>This is the Co-op's killer feature. Open the app every week and you get to pick two personalized offers. Don't just accept the defaults. Scroll through and choose the discounts on things you actually buy. It's like creating your own sale.</p>
                
                <h2>Secret #3: Master the Meal Deals</h2>
                <p>Co-op's special promotions, like their "freezer filler" bundles or pizza deals, are where the big value is. Buying the items together in the deal is often dramatically cheaper than buying them separately. Keep an eye out for these—we list them on <a href="https://risij.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risij.uk</a> every week.</p>

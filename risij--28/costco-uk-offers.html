                    Costco offers a unique shopping model focused on bulk buys and member-exclusive deals. While the membership fee requires commitment, a strategic approach using the <a href="https://risij.uk/costco-uk-offers" target="_blank">Costco UK offers</a> can lead to substantial long-term savings, especially for families and small businesses.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Is a Costco Membership Worth It?</h2>
                <p>
                    Value from Costco comes from buying items with a long shelf life that you use regularly. By purchasing in bulk, you lower the per-unit cost significantly. Focus on these categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pantry & Household Staples:</strong> Items like toilet paper, kitchen roll, cleaning supplies, coffee, and rice offer huge savings over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Quality Kirkland Signature Products:</strong> Costco's own brand often matches or exceeds the quality of leading brands at a lower price point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Petrol and Tyres:</strong> Costco's fuel stations are often the cheapest in the area, which alone can quickly offset the membership cost for regular drivers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Find the Best Costco Deals</h2>
                <h3>1. Read the Coupon Book</h3>
                <p>Costco mails out a monthly coupon book filled with extra discounts. These are automatically applied at the till, but reviewing the book helps you plan your visit around the best deals.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Look for Price-Code Clues</h3>
                <p>Learn to read the price tags. A price ending in .97 often indicates a manager's markdown, meaning it's the lowest price you'll see. An asterisk (*) on the tag means the item won't be restocked, so it's your last chance to buy.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Check Risij.uk for Offer Highlights</h3>

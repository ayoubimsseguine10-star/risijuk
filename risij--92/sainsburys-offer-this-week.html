                <p>If you're shopping at Sainsbury's without a Nectar card, you're doing it wrong. Their entire savings system is now built around "Nectar Prices." This is your essential 101 guide to how it works and how you can save on the <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sainsbury's offer this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>What Are Nectar Prices?</h2>
                <p>It's a simple two-tier pricing system. On hundreds of products, you'll see two prices on the shelf ticket: a standard price and a much lower price with the Nectar logo.</p>
                <p><strong>To get the lower price, you just have to scan your Nectar card or app at the checkout.</strong></p>
                <p>That's it. There's no catch. If you don't scan, you pay the higher price. The savings are often huge, so not using a Nectar card is like throwing money away.</p>

                <h2>Your Simple 2-Step Strategy</h2>
                <p>Saving money at Sainsbury's is now incredibly straightforward.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Get a Nectar Card:</strong> It's free. You can get a physical card in-store or just download the app. This is the key that unlocks all the savings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scan It Every Time:</strong> Whether you're buying one thing or a whole trolley's worth, make scanning your Nectar card a habit. It's the only way to get the best prices.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Pro Tip: Check for Bonus Offers</h3>
                <p>The Nectar app also gives you personalized bonus point offers. Before you shop, open the app and save any offers that are relevant to you. This lets you collect points faster, which you can then use for money off future shops. Use a site like <a href="https://risij.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risij.uk</a> to see the main Nectar Prices before you go.</p>

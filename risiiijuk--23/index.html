                            <h2>Make Your Nectar Card Your Superpower</h2>
                            <p>Your Nectar card is more than just a points collector. Use the app to get weekly personalised offers and look for the 'Nectar Prices' in-store for instant, hefty discounts. This is how you win at Sainsbury's.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Your Sainsbury's Strategy Guide:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Embrace the Aldi Price Match:</strong> Sainsbury's matches Aldi's prices on hundreds of staples. This is your chance to get great quality at discounter prices. Look for the signs!</li>
                                <li><strong>Nectar Prices are King:</strong> The difference between the regular price and the Nectar price can be massive. Never shop without your card.</li>
                                <li><strong>Imperfectly Tasty, Perfectly Smart:</strong> Grab their 'wonky veg' range. It's cheaper, just as tasty, and you're helping to cut down on food waste. Win-win.</li>

                            <p>In the world of Tesco, the Clubcard is king. If you're not using it, you are literally throwing money away.

                            <p>The single most important rule of shopping at Tesco: always scan your Clubcard. The difference in price is no joke. The app is the easiest way to make sure you've always got it on you. No excuses!</p>

                                <li><strong>Double Up Your Vouchers:</strong> Don't just spend your vouchers on your shopping. Check the Reward Partners section in the app. You can often double or triple their value for days out or restaurant meals.</li>
                                <li><strong>Yellow Sticker Hunting:</strong> Tesco can be a goldmine for reduced items. The late evening is prime time, but keep your eyes peeled whenever you're in store.</li>

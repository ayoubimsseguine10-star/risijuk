# Risij.uk [Terminal] - Static Blog (2025 Dark Mode / Tech Theme)

## Description

This is a responsive and SEO-friendly static blog for Risij.uk, completely redesigned with a "Dark Mode / Tech" theme for 2025. It is built entirely with pure HTML and CSS, with zero JavaScript or external frameworks. The blog's purpose is to serve as an analysis engine and documentation hub for the main Risij.uk data platform.

The design mimics a modern data terminal or developer dashboard, focusing on clarity, high contrast, and a professional, tech-focused aesthetic. It features an electric cyan accent color against a dark charcoal background. The typography pairs the monospaced 'IBM Plex Mono' for headings with the clean sans-serif 'Inter' for body text, creating a highly readable and modern user experience.

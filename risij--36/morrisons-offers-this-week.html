                <ul>
                    <li><strong>My Morrisons Rewards:</strong> This app-based scheme is essential. It provides personalized money-off coupons on products you actually buy. Always activate your offers before you shop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Street Deals:</strong> Look for special promotions at the fresh counters. These often provide superior quality and value compared to pre-packaged alternatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly Savers:</strong> Scan the aisles for deals on major brands and pantry essentials, which are updated every week.</li>

                <h2>Top Tips for Shopping at Morrisons</h2>
                <h3>1. Activate Your App Offers First</h3>
                <p>Before you even write your shopping list, open the My Morrisons app to see your personalized offers. This helps shape your meal plan and guarantees you don't miss out on savings tailored specifically to you.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Engage with Market Street</h3>
                <p>Don't hesitate to talk to the staff at the fresh counters. They can offer advice on the best cuts of meat or the day's freshest catch, and you can buy the exact quantity you need, which helps to reduce food waste.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Hunt for Evening Reductions</h3>
                <p>Morrisons is known for its end-of-day reductions on fresh items. Their "Magic Boxes" on the Too Good To Go app are also a fantastic way to get a surprise selection of quality food at a steep discount.</p>

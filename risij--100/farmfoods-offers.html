                    <h2>Your Freezer is a Financial Tool</h2>
                    <p>Think of your freezer not as a cold box, but as a savings account. Farmfoods is the bank. A stocked freezer protects you from price hikes, kills food waste, and makes weeknight meals effortless. The core strategy is to buy in bulk when prices are low.

                    <h3>The Farmfoods Procurement Protocol:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get on their mailing list. The exclusive money-off vouchers they send are pure gold.</li>
                        <li>Target the huge multi-buy deals on proteins and vegetables. This is the foundation of your savings.</li>
                        <li>Make a list and stick to it. The aisles are designed to make you overspend on snacks. Don't fall for it.</li>

                    <p>Don't get tunnel vision. Farmfoods has a solid range of dry goods and chilled essentials. If you can do your entire weekly shop in one place, you're not just saving money on food, you're saving time and fuel. Factor that into your calculations.</p>

                <p>Let's make this simple. There are lots of ways to try and save money, but when it comes to the <a href="https://risij.uk/tesco-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesco offers this week</a>, there is only one rule that matters in 2025:</p>
                <p><strong>You MUST use a Clubcard on every single shop.</strong></p>
                <p>It's no longer a fun little bonus. It's the entire game. Shopping at Tesco without a Clubcard is like willingly paying a 30% penalty tax. Here’s the breakdown.</p>
                
                <h2>The Power of Clubcard Prices</h2>
                <p>Tesco now operates a two-price system. There's the standard price, and then there's the much cheaper "Clubcard Price." These aren't tiny discounts; they are massive price cuts on everyday items, from chicken to coffee to laundry detergent.</p>
                <p>To unlock these lower prices, all you have to do is scan your Clubcard (physical or on the app) at the till. If you don't, you pay the full, inflated price. End of story.</p>
                
                <h2>Your Simple 3-Step Tesco Plan</h2>
                <p>This isn't complicated. Just follow these steps.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Get a Clubcard:</strong> It's free and takes two minutes. No excuses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the Deals:</strong> Before you shop, look at a site like <a href="https://risij.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risij.uk</a> to see what the best Clubcard Prices are for the week. Plan your meals around them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scan, Scan, Scan:</strong> Make it a reflex. Whether you're at a self-checkout or a till, the first thing you should do is scan your Clubcard.</li>
                </ol>

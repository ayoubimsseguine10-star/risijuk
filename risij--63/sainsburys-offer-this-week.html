                <p class="intro">The Nectar card is one of the UK's most powerful loyalty tools. To extract its full potential, you need to go beyond simple point collection. This guide will show you how to supercharge your earnings with the <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sainsbury's offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>The New Foundation: Nectar Prices</h2>
                <p>Sainsbury's has adopted a model similar to Tesco's Clubcard, introducing "Nectar Prices." These are instant, significant discounts available exclusively to cardholders. This shift makes scanning your Nectar card on every single transaction absolutely essential.</p>
                
                <h3>Power-Up #1: Activate Personalised App Offers</h3>
                <p>The Nectar app is your control panel for bonus points. Each week, it generates a unique set of bonus offers based on your shopping DNA. You must manually 'save' these offers in the app before you shop to activate the bonus. Missing this step is like leaving free money on the table.</p>

                <h3>Power-Up #2: The "Double Up" Endgame</h3>
                <p>Periodically, Sainsbury's hosts "Double Up" events. These limited-time windows allow you to exchange your points for vouchers worth twice their standard cash value, redeemable against categories like clothing, homewares, and seasonal goods. Hoarding your points for these events is the ultimate Nectar strategy.</p>

                <h2>The Pro Move: Stacking Your Deals</h2>
                <p>Elite Nectar users master the art of "stacking." This involves purchasing a product that is simultaneously on a Nectar Price promotion and has a personalised bonus points offer in your app. This double-dip—saving money upfront while earning an inflated number of points—is the key to maximizing your return. It's a more intricate system than the straightforward <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASDA offers this week</a>, but the rewards are far greater.</p>

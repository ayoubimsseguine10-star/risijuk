            <p>Iceland's product range has expanded far beyond frozen food, now encompassing a complete grocery selection. However, their most powerful tool for savings remains consistent: the Bonus Card. Understanding this scheme is crucial to maximizing the <a href="https://risij.uk/iceland-offers-this-week" target="_blank">Iceland offers this week</a>.</p>

            <h2>The 5% Rule: How the Bonus Card Works</h2>
            <p>The Iceland Bonus Card is not a points card; it's a direct savings mechanism. Its genius lies in its simplicity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-load Your Spend:</strong> You add funds to your Bonus Card before you shop.</li>
                <li><strong>Receive an Instant Bonus:</strong> For every £20 you load onto the card, Iceland immediately adds an extra £1.</li>
                <li><strong>Guaranteed 5% Saving:</strong> This mechanism provides an automatic 5% return on your money, which you can then spend on anything in-store, including items already on promotion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Targeting Top-Tier Offers</h2>
            <p>With your 5% baseline saving secured, you can then focus on Iceland's aggressive promotional calendar to stack your discounts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Value Multi-buys:</strong> The "3 for £10" deal is a recurring favourite, often including popular branded items like pizzas and ready meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Exclusive Brand Partnerships:</strong> Iceland is the exclusive home for grocery ranges from popular brands like Greggs, TGI Fridays, and Slimming World.</li>
                <li><strong>Free Delivery Perk:</strong> In-store shoppers can benefit from free same-day home delivery when they meet a minimum spend (typically £25), adding a layer of convenience.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Morrisons' key differentiator is its "Market Street" concept, an in-store simulation of a traditional market that offers a strategic advantage in fresh provisions. This guide details how to leverage this unique feature alongside the best <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week">Morrisons offers this week</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Core Asset: Market Street</h2>
                    <p>Market Street, with its on-site butchers, bakers, and fishmongers, provides access to expertise and product quality not found in other scaled retailers. Monitor the counters for daily specials and manager's markdowns. The most current fresh deals are indexed on the <a href="https://risij.uk">Risij.uk</a> Morrisons data feed.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Protocols for a High-Efficiency Morrisons Run</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interface with the My Morrisons App:</strong> This loyalty program is based on personalized discounts and direct money-off coupons, not points. A pre-shop app audit is essential.</li>
                        <li><strong>Utilize the "Too Good To Go" Partnership:</strong> Morrisons uses this app to sell surplus food at a steep discount near closing time, offering a powerful tool for cost reduction and waste prevention.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capitalize on the Salad Bar:</strong> Morrisons' salad bar often provides superior value and greater variety compared to pre-packaged alternatives.</li>
                    </ul>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>My Morrisons Rewards:</strong> This app-based scheme is crucial. It provides personalized money-off coupons on items you actually buy. Always activate them before you shop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Street Offers:</strong> Look for special deals at the fresh counters. These are often better value and higher quality than pre-packaged alternatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly Savers:</strong> Check the aisles for promotions on big brands and pantry staples, which are updated every week.</li>

                <h2>Top Tips for Shopping at Morrisons</h2>
                <h3>1. Check the My Morrisons App First</h3>
                <p>Before writing your list, open the app to see your personalized offers. This helps shape your meal plan and guarantees you won't miss savings tailored to you.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Don't Skip Market Street</h3>
                <p>Talk to the staff at the counters. They can offer advice on the best cuts of meat or the freshest fish, and you can buy the exact quantity you need, which helps reduce food waste.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Look for End-of-Day Reductions</h3>
                <p>Like many supermarkets, Morrisons reduces items towards the end of the day. Their "Magic Boxes" on the Too Good To Go app are also a fantastic way to get a surprise selection of food at a very low price.</p>

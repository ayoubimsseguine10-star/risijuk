                        <p>Waitrose is known for its high-quality produce and premium products, but that doesn't mean it's out of reach for savvy shoppers.

                        <h2>Look for Yellow-Sticker Reductions</h2>
                        <p>Like all supermarkets, Waitrose reduces items that are near their sell-by date. The times for these reductions vary by store, but they often happen in the evening. This is a fantastic way to pick up high-quality ready meals, meat, and baked goods for a fraction of their original price.</p>

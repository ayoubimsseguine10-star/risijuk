                        <h2>What to Look for at Spar</h2>
                        <p>Spar stores are independently owned, so offers can sometimes vary by region, but many promotions are national. Key deals often include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Meal Deals:</strong> Great value bundles for lunch or an easy evening meal, often including a main, snack, and drink.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wine and Beer Offers:</strong> Spar frequently has competitive deals on alcohol, perfect for the weekend.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weekly Specials:</strong> Look out for promotions on everyday items like bread, milk, and household cleaning products.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Waitrose has a reputation for quality, and a reputation for being expensive. The first is true, the second is optional. With the right tactics, you can get the quality you want without the financial pain. This is your playbook for hacking the <a href="https://risij.uk/waitrose-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waitrose offers this week</a>.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Tactic 1: The myWaitrose Card Is Mandatory</h2>
                        <p>Walking into Waitrose without a myWaitrose card (or app) is a rookie error. This free tool is your key to unlocking value.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Member Prices:</strong> Just like other stores, this gets you instant discounts at the till. Hunt for the signs and always scan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personalised Vouchers:</strong> Check your app weekly. You get to choose your own money-off vouchers. Select the ones for products you actually buy to guarantee savings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Counter Deals:</strong> Don't forget the 20% off the fish and meat counters, typically on a Friday. This is a huge, often overlooked, perk.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Tactic 2: Master the "Essential" Range</h2>
                        <p>The "Essential Waitrose" brand is your secret weapon. It’s Waitrose's own-brand range, and the quality is famously high while the prices are fiercely competitive. Building your basket around Essential items for your staples is the fastest way to slash your bill.</p>

                        <p>Waitrose's end-of-day reductions are legendary.

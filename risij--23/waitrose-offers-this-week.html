                    <p>Waitrose & Partners is synonymous with premium quality, but this doesn't preclude excellent value.

                        <li><strong>The Famous Free Coffee:</strong> A cherished perk for many, cardholders can enjoy a complimentary hot drink with any purchase when they bring a reusable cup.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exclusive Member Prices:</strong> Look for the "myWaitrose price" signs throughout the store for instant discounts on a wide range of products.</li>

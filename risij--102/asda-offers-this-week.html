            <p>ASDA has two main ways to help you save: the classic 'Rollback' and the modern ASDA Rewards app. Understanding how each one works is key to getting the best value from the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASDA offers this week</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>What is a 'Rollback'?</h2>
            <p>A Rollback is a straightforward price cut. ASDA lowers the price of a product for an extended period, making it cheaper than its usual price. These are great opportunities to stock up on household staples or your favourite branded goods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Look for:</strong> The prominent green 'Rollback' signs in-store.</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Stocking up on non-perishables and frozen foods.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Does the ASDA Rewards App Work?</h2>
            <p>The ASDA Rewards app is a cashback system. Instead of getting a discount at the till, you build up a 'Cashpot' of money that you can spend on a future shop. You earn money in two main ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Star Products:</strong> Buy specific items marked as 'Star Products' to get a percentage of their value (usually 10%) back in your Cashpot.</li>
                <li><strong>Missions:</strong> Complete simple tasks, like "buy 5 pieces of fruit," to earn a cash bonus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The best strategy is to look for a product that is both on Rollback and is also a Star Product. This way, you save instantly and earn cashback at the same time.

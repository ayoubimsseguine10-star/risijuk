                    <p>ASDA positions itself as the champion of low prices for families, but to truly maximize your savings, you need to understand their deal structure. The <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week" target="_blank">ASDA offers this week</a> are more than just yellow labels; here’s how to find the real bargains.</p>

                    <h2>The Truth About "Rollback"</h2>
                    <p>ASDA's signature promotion is the "Rollback," a sustained price drop on a specific item. Unlike a temporary weekend sale, a Rollback can last for weeks. These are reliable savings on staples, from coffee to cleaning products. Always check the dedicated Rollback aisles, but also compare the price-per-unit to competitors to ensure it's a true deal.</p>

                    <h2>The Multi-Buy Trap (And How to Avoid It)</h2>
                    <p>ASDA is full of multi-buy deals like "2 for £6" or "3 for £10." These can offer great value, but only if you're smart about it. Before you load up your trolley, ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Will my family actually use all of this before it expires?</li>
                            <li>Is the price of a single item at a competitor like the <a href="lidl-offers-this-week.html">Lidl offers this week</a> still a better deal?</li>
                            <li>Am I buying it because I need it, or just because it's on offer?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Smart multi-buys save money; impulsive ones waste it.</p>

                    <h2>Don't Forget George at ASDA</h2>
                    <p>Beyond groceries, ASDA's George brand is a powerhouse in affordable fashion and homeware. Seasonal sales events for George are the perfect time to stock up on essentials like school uniforms, bedding, and kids' clothing at a fraction of high-street prices.</p>

## Design Philosophy: 2025 Futurist Dark Theme

The visual design is a modern, tech-inspired dark theme. The goal was to create a sleek, high-contrast interface that feels like an intelligence command center for savvy shoppers.

- **Color Palette:** A deep charcoal background (`#121212`) is paired with an electric blue accent (`#00BFFF`) for a futuristic, high-energy look.
- **Typography:**
    - **Headings:** `Montserrat` (bold, impactful, modern).
    - **Body:** `Open Sans` (clean, highly readable, neutral).

## Key Features

- **Pure HTML/CSS:** No JavaScript or external frameworks for maximum performance and simplicity.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox for a seamless experience on all devices.
- **SEO Optimized:** Semantic HTML (`<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`), unique meta tags for every page, and keyword-rich content.
- **Complete Site Structure:** Includes a homepage, sub-pages (Offers, About, Contact), and 12 individual, fully-written article pages.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Features include a sticky header, smooth hover effects, and a clear, intuitive layout.

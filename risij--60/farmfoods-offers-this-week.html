                    <li><strong>Sign Up for Vouchers:</strong> Visit the Farmfoods website and sign up with your email address. They regularly send out money-off vouchers (e.g., £2 off a £25 spend) that can be printed or shown on your phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for "Amazing Value" Deals:</strong> Farmfoods often groups products into multi-buy deals, like "3 for £5". This is where the biggest savings are found. Plan your purchases around these offers.</li>

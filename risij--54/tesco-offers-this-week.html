                    <p>Tesco's Clubcard has evolved from a simple points card into a powerful tool for instant savings. To really benefit from the <a href="https://risij.uk/tesco-offers-this-week">Tesco offers this week</a>, understanding "Clubcard Prices" is absolutely essential.</p>

                    <h2>What Are Clubcard Prices?</h2>
                    <p>Clubcard Prices are lower prices on a wide range of products, available exclusively to Clubcard holders. The discount is applied instantly at the checkout when you scan your Clubcard or app. The difference between the regular price and the Clubcard price can be substantial, often making it one of the biggest ways to save at Tesco.</p>

                    <h3>How to Make the Most of Your Clubcard</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Always Scan Your Card:</strong> This is the golden rule. No scan, no discount. Get into the habit of having your Clubcard (or the Tesco app) ready at the checkout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check the App for Coupons:</strong> The Tesco Grocery & Clubcard app often has extra digital coupons that you can apply to your shop for even more savings on top of Clubcard Prices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for the Yellow Labels:</strong> In-store, Clubcard Prices are clearly marked with bright yellow labels, making them easy to spot.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This model has become so popular that other supermarkets, like Sainsbury's with their Nectar Prices, have followed suit. It's always worth comparing the <a href="https://risij.uk/sainsburys-offer-this-week">Sainsbury's offer this week</a> to see who has the better member-only deals.</p>

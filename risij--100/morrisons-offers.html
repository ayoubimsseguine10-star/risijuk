                    <h2>The Market Street Advantage</h2>
                    <p>Morrisons' "Market Street" fresh counters are their secret weapon, and most shoppers don't use them correctly. The price-per-kilo at the butcher and fishmonger is often cheaper than the pre-packaged stuff. Your mission is to check the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrisons offers this week</a> on Risij.uk to see which counter has the best deals, and build your meal plan around that.</p>
                    <h3>Market Street Tactical Protocol:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compare counter prices to packaged prices. The savings are often hiding in plain sight.</li>
                        <li>Talk to the staff. They know what's good and can give you exactly the amount you need, reducing waste.</li>
                        <li>Hit the store late. The end-of-day yellow sticker deals on fresh counter items are legendary.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The "My Morrisons" App: Your Personal Deal Engine</h2>
                    <p>The "My Morrisons" app isn't about collecting points; it's about getting personalized price cuts sent directly to you. It learns what you buy and sends you money-off coupons for those exact items. The trick is to always check the app and activate your offers *before* you start shopping. Forgetting this one step is like leaving free money on the table.</p>

                        <p>Finding the best offers requires a bit of planning. Here are the most effective methods:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>In-Store Signage:</strong> Big, bold signs throughout the store make it easy to spot the current promotions.</li>

                            <li><strong>Focus on Multi-buys:</strong> Deals like "3 for £5" on frozen pizzas or "2 for £10" on large bags of chicken are where you'll find the biggest savings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Have Freezer Space:</strong> This might sound obvious, but ensure you have enough room in your freezer before you go. A well-timed bulk shop can last for weeks.</li>

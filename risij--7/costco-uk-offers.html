                    <p>Costco operates on a different model from your typical supermarket. As a wholesale, membership-only club, it offers the potential for huge savings, but only if you know how to approach it. The exclusive <a href="https://risij.uk/costco-uk-offers">Costco UK offers</a> are a major draw, but the key is smart bulk buying.</p>

                    <h2>Is a Costco Membership Worth It?</h2>
                    <p>Before diving into the deals, you need a membership. This annual fee is the biggest hurdle for many. A membership is likely worth it if you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have a large family or are buying for a group.</li>
                        <li>Have ample storage space (a large pantry, chest freezer, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Regularly buy items that Costco sells cheaply, such as petrol, tyres, electronics, or household supplies.</li>
                        <li>Can resist impulse buys and stick to your list.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How to Find the Best Costco Deals</h2>
                    <h3>1. The Coupon Book</h3>
                    <p>Costco's monthly "Coupon Book" is your guide to the best deals. These aren't physical coupons you clip; the discounts are applied automatically at checkout during the promotion period. We list the highlights from the coupon book on our <a href="https://risij.uk/costco-uk-offers">Costco offers page</a> at Risij.uk so you can plan ahead.</p>

                    <h3>2. Look for the Asterisk (*)</h3>
                    <p>If you see an asterisk on the price tag in the top right corner, it means that item is being discontinued. If it's a product you love, now is the time to stock up as it won't be coming back.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Kirkland Signature Brand</h3>
                    <p>Costco's own brand, Kirkland Signature, is renowned for its high quality, often matching or exceeding that of major brands but at a lower price. From coffee to batteries, it's almost always a great deal.</p>

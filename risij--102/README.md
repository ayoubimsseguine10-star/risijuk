# Risij.uk Static Blog - 2025 "Clean" Theme

## Project Overview

This is a complete, static blog for **Risij.uk**, a platform dedicated to showcasing weekly offers from UK supermarkets. This version implements a "Clean Blog" theme for 2025, focusing on clarity, readability, and a friendly, modern user experience.

The entire website is built with pure HTML5 and CSS3. There is no JavaScript, ensuring the site is extremely lightweight, fast, and secure. The primary goal is to provide high-quality, SEO-focused content that gives users practical shopping advice, ultimately driving traffic to the main `risij.uk` deals platform.

## Key Features

-   **Purely Static:** Built with only HTML and CSS for maximum performance and simplicity.
-   **Clean & Modern Theme:** A bright, airy design using a light background, a vibrant blue accent color, and generous white space.
-   **New Typography:** Uses Google Fonts for a clean and readable combination: 'Montserrat' for headings and 'Open Sans' for body text.
-   **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design that ensures a seamless experience across all devices, from phones to desktops.
-   **SEO-Focused:** Every page includes semantic HTML, unique meta titles and descriptions, and all required anchor links to target URLs for a strong SEO foundation.
-   **Completely Rephrased Content:** All text has been rewritten to be clear, helpful, and straightforward, matching the blog's clean aesthetic.
-   **Comprehensive Structure:** Includes a homepage, 12 individual article pages for major UK supermarkets, and essential sub-pages (Offers, About, Contact).

## File Structure

The project uses a simple, flat structure that is easy to manage and deploy on any static hosting service.

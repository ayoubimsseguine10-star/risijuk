                <p class="intro">ASDA is a go-to for many families thanks to its competitive pricing and wide range of products. Understanding how their promotions work is key to maximizing your savings. Let's dive into the <a href="https://risij.uk/asda-offers-this-week">ASDA offers this week</a>.</p>

                <h2>Decoding "Rollback"</h2>
                <p>ASDA's most famous promotion is the "Rollback." This is a simple price reduction on a specific product for a limited time. Unlike complex multi-buy deals, it's a straightforward discount. You can find Rollbacks on everything from everyday groceries to George clothing.</p>
                
                <h3>Tip 1: Look for the Green Arrow</h3>
                <p>In-store, Rollback items are clearly marked with green arrows on the price labels. When browsing online, they are also highlighted. Keep an eye out for these as you shop to spot instant savings.</p>

                <h3>Tip 2: Compare with Other Stores</h3>
                <p>A Rollback is great, but is it the best price available? It's always wise to compare with other retailers. For example, check the <a href="https://risij.uk/tesco-offers-this-week">Tesco offers this week</a> to see if their Clubcard price on a similar item is even lower.</p>

                <h2>Other Ways to Save at ASDA</h2>
                <p>Beyond Rollbacks, ASDA also offers multi-buy deals (e.g., "2 for £3"). These are great for stocking up on items you use regularly. Always check the single-item price to ensure the multi-buy offers genuine value, a good habit to have whether you're shopping at ASDA or checking the <a href="https://risij.uk/morrisons-offers-this-week">Morrisons offers this week</a>.</p>

# Risij.uk Static Blog - 2025 "Dark" Theme

## Overview

This project is a complete redesign of the static blog for **Risij.uk**, a platform dedicated to showcasing weekly supermarket offers in the UK. This version is built around a modern "Dark Blog" aesthetic for 2025, emphasizing readability, a clean UI, and a premium feel.

The blog remains built entirely with pure HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring it is lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain. The primary goal is to provide high-value, SEO-rich content that helps users save money, while simultaneously driving traffic to the main `risij.uk` offer-aggregation website.

## Key Features

-   **Pure HTML & CSS:** No JavaScript frameworks or libraries for optimal performance and simplicity.
-   **Modern Dark Theme:** A sophisticated dark color palette with vibrant accents for excellent readability and visual appeal.
-   **Updated Typography:** Uses Google Fonts ('Poppins' for headings, 'Open Sans' for body) for a clean and modern look.
-   **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first, fluid design that looks great on all devices.
-   **SEO-Focused:** Built with semantic HTML5, unique meta information for every page, and strategically placed internal and external links.
-   **Expanded Content:** Now includes dedicated guide pages for 12 major UK supermarkets.
-   **Cohesive Design:** A consistent and professional UI/UX across all pages, including headers, footers, article cards, and sidebars.
-   **Engaging Micro-interactions:** Subtle hover effects and transitions enhance the user experience.

## File Structure

The project contains a comprehensive set of HTML files for the homepage, sub-pages, and 12 individual article guides, all styled by a single CSS file.
